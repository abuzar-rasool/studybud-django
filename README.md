# StudyBuddy - Django
This is my first django project which was created along with following the tutorial.

[Python Django 7 Hour Course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI&t=17134s)  

The course was pretty comprehensive in terms of content and follwoing are my key learnings from this project.
